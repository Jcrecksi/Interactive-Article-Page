		<h1>What can you connect to the iPhone 15 with USB-C?</h1>
		<p>On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, Apple finally got rid of the Lightning port and replaced it with USB-C. This opens up a whole new world of convenience of connecting accessories and peripherals. <mark> iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max go one step further</mark>, as the USB-C port on the pro models supports USB-3 speeds, enabling up to 10 Gbps data transfer speeds.I'm baby kickstarter authentic farm-to-table fam whatever.

       <mark>Why did Apple change from Lightning?</mark>
     </h2>
		<p>
			Apple was fully invested in Lightning port ecosystem on the iPhone. However, it began adopting USB-C across Mac and iPad models since 2015 as a way to modernize PC connectivity. USB-C is versatile, carrying power and data with the same connector. And USB-4 / Thunderbolt offers even higher data transfer speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
             At the same time, USB-C was becoming increasingly popular on the Android side of the smartphone market. But Apple stuck with Lightning on iPhone, partly because they were still stung from the backlash of 30-pin -> Lightning transition that happened more than a decade ago.
         </p>
         <p>
             <mark>The forcing factor for Apple was the EU commission</mark>, who have passed legislation to reduce e-waste by enforcing USB-C as the universal connector for phones. That would mean Apple would at least have to make a special model of iPhone for the European market. That brings its own complications. Instead, Apple chose to just adopt USB-C across the board … and apart from the frustration of customers having to change out all their existing now-defunct Lightning cables, that brings a lot of benefits …
